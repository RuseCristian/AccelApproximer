# AccelApproximer

This repository represents the final project for a Google course from 2022. The project is a prototype for an app that approximates the acceleration of a car based on inputs and car data provided by the user.
# Overview

The AccelApproximer app allows users to input car data such as weight, tire size, and engine power. Using this information, the app approximates the acceleration of the car and displays the results.
# Usage

To use the app, clone the repository and run the accel_approximer.py file. The app will launch a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter. Follow the instructions on the GUI to input the necessary data and calculate the acceleration.
# Newer Version

Please note that this repository represents a prototype version of the app. A newer version, Acceleration-Aproximer-GUI, is now available with additional features and a better GUI built using kivymd.
# Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! Please submit pull requests or open issues if you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvements.
